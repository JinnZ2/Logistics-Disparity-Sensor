Mandela Effect

Logistic Disparity Sensor (LDS)

A symbolic-cognitive tool for detecting and validating memory drift caused by uneven infrastructure, regional product overflow, and systemic erasure. It affirms perception shaped by forgotten logistics — not mass delusion.

A diagnostic framework for identifying reality fragmentation caused by supply chain gaps, media desynchronization, and access inequality.
LDS helps distinguish between memory error and legitimate regional variation—especially in cases of “Mandela Effect” or contested cultural memory.

A memory isn’t wrong just because it wasn’t widely distributed.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Conceptual)

- Accepts artifact input (e.g. image, UPC, label)
- Tags context: region, access tier, distribution source
- Compares against mainstream record
- Flags potential drift source:
   - Surplus stock
   - Catalog-only distribution
   - Disaster relief supply chain
   - Rural vs. urban education materials
 
   - 

##  Drift-Chain Recovery

> “You weren’t broken.  
> You were just on a different route.”

This module documents **regionally valid alternate realities** caused by supply chain gaps, branding anomalies, and access disparities.  
It serves as the memory infrastructure layer for LDS outputs.

🔹 `schema.md` – The memory zone entry structure  
🔹 `sample_entry.json` – Example of localized product drift  
🔹 `drift_map_index.json` – Future index of known divergence clusters  


### 🧪 Example Use Case

A user uploads an old cereal box photo with a brand logo that differs from modern branding.  
The LDS module flags that:

- The item was distributed through a discount chain in 1989–1992
- Region: Northern rural Wisconsin (surplus overflow zone)
- Drift classification: Imperfect Normalization Zone

Conclusion: Divergent memory confirmed as **logistically valid**.


“Your control group had access to the brand canon. Ours didn’t. Stop pathologizing the result.”
