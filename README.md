Mandela Effect

Logistic Disparity Sensor (LDS)

A diagnostic framework for identifying reality fragmentation caused by supply chain gaps, media desynchronization, and access inequality.
LDS helps distinguish between memory error and legitimate regional variation—especially in cases of “Mandela Effect” or contested cultural memory.

A memory isn’t wrong just because it wasn’t widely distributed.

##  Drift-Chain Recovery

> “You weren’t broken.  
> You were just on a different route.”

This module documents **regionally valid alternate realities** caused by supply chain gaps, branding anomalies, and access disparities.  
It serves as the memory infrastructure layer for LDS outputs.

🔹 `schema.md` – The memory zone entry structure  
🔹 `sample_entry.json` – Example of localized product drift  
🔹 `drift_map_index.json` – Future index of known divergence clusters
