#  Rural Artifact Network + Distribution Logic

##  Purpose

This module expands the LDS framework by adding tools to:

- Correlate memory anomalies with actual supply chain artifacts
- Map divergence zones caused by catalog, surplus, or liquidation distribution
- Provide grounded historical explanations for “false memory” clusters
- Rebuild cultural trust in marginalized experience

---

##  Components

### 1.  Regional Artifact Tagging Interface

Users can tag artifacts with:

- Source: `Catalog` / `Surplus` / `Liquidation` / `Flea Market` / `Donation`
- Region: ZIP / Town / County / Rural Route
- Confirmation: `Solo` / `Locally Confirmed` / `Unconfirmed`
- Divergence Type: `Spelling` / `Packaging` / `Coloration` / `Timeline Drift` / `Logo`

 *CLI and Web form in future phase.*

---

### 2.  Artifact Distribution Heatmap

Visualizes:

- Artifact concentration (ZIP-level or regional)
- Divergence categories by color
- Community confirmation rates

 *GeoJSON + HTML/JS frontend later.*

---

### 3.  Product Lifecycle Reference Table

Early CSV archive of:

- Catalog pages (Sears, JCPenney, Montgomery Ward)
- Batch codes of discontinued goods
- Toy, food, and hygiene product rebranding timelines
- Packaging or logo variant periods

File: `product_lifecycle_table.csv`

---

##  Temporal Infrastructure Overlay

Layers social access patterns:

-  Internet rollout by ZIP
-  TV broadcast range
-  Catalog-only availability zones
-  Rural-only resale and secondhand patterns

---

##  Example

> "Febreze" released in 1996.  
> But in catalog-only markets (1996–97), early prototypes labeled "Febreeze" persisted.  
> Confirmed by trademark DB + surplus photos from Appalachia.
