Mandela Effect

Logistic Disparity Sensor (LDS)

A diagnostic framework for identifying reality fragmentation caused by supply chain gaps, media desynchronization, and access inequality.
LDS helps distinguish between memory error and legitimate regional variation—especially in cases of “Mandela Effect” or contested cultural memory.

A memory isn’t wrong just because it wasn’t widely distributed.
