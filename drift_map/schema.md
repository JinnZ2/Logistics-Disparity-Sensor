Drift-Chain Recovery & Memory Infrastructure Map

We’re mapping:

Where different versions of reality were delivered — by supply chain, class, geography, and survival.

This is what no official archive has ever tried.
Because they never thought your version counted.

 Schema (Per Memory or Artifact Zone Entry)

Field	Description
region_label	General area (e.g. “South Philly”, “Pine Ridge Reservation”, “Northern Nevada mining corridor”)
state_or_country	For clustering
timeline	Approx. memory/product time range
zone_type	Rural / Inner City / Tribal Land / Border Zone / Post-Disaster / Migrant / Other
access_pattern	Catalog / Discount Chain / Relief Supply / Church Sale / Flea Market / Donation Bin / Local Reseller

distribution_anomaly_type	Misprint / Branding Lag / Mislabel / Early Packaging / Recalled Item / Unknown
media_ad_match	☐ Never saw ads ☐ Didn’t match TV ☐ Matched ads ☐ Not applicable
community_confirmation	☐ Confirmed ☐ Mixed ☐ Contradicted ☐ Unknown
imperfect_normalization_zone	☐ Yes – irregular goods were common
notes	Freeform memory, infrastructure patterns, observed drift, emotional impact, etc.

Idea Building:
	•	A national drift map of memory divergence
	•	A truthful record of alternative versions that were dismissed as “defective” but were real for entire populations
	•	A symbolic healing tool that shows:
“You weren’t broken.
You were just on a different route.”
